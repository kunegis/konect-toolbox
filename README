== KONECT Toolbox ==

This is a toolbox for the analysis of large complex networks written in
Matlab, but also largely compatible with GNU Octave.  It is part of the
KONECT project by Jérôme Kunegis at the University of Namur, Belgium:

http://konect.cc/

This toolbox implements individual network analysis functions,
statistics and some machine learning methods.  If you want a complete
"run all analyses on this network" package, use the KONECT Analysis
package:

This toolbox largely implements the graph analysis functions described in 
the KONECT Handbook: 

https://github.com/kunegis/konect-handbook/blob/master/konect-handbook.pdf

In particular, the KONECT Handbook contains all formal definitions of
the computations performed in this toolbox.

=== Installation ===

The toolbox consists entirely of *.m files.  To use it, add the
directory m/ to the Matlab path, e.g., using addpath() or by setting the
$MATLABPATH variable.

GNU Octave too supports the addpath() function and $MATLABPATH
variable. 

=== Requirements ===

Some functions need Matlab-BGL, the Matlab port of the Boost Graph
Library.    

Installation of Matlab-BGL:
* Download version 4.0.1 from the Matlab-BGL website (newer versions may
  not work) 
* Unzip it somewhere where you'll keep it
* (On a few old Debian-based systems, we needed to install libstdc++5 from http://packages.debian.org/stable/base/libstdc++5) 
* Make sure matlab_bgl/ is the the Matlab path.  This is necessary for
  both GNU Octave and Matlab.  For instance, do
	export MATLABPATH="$MATLABPATH:~/matlab_bgl/"
  (But probably you have your own way of setting the Matlab path.)

=== Usage ===

The toolbox consists of individual functions, each of which is
contained in its own *.m file in the m/ directory.  

Most functions are self-contained, and can be used as-is. 

Each function is documented in its source file.  

The source files contain UTF-8 encoded text in the comments; the rest is
ASCII.  

The functions are used from both GNU Octave Matlab and Matlab.  Since none of
these is properly standardised, we can't assure that all versions will
work -- when in doubt, ask. 

If you fix bugs or add new features, please contact Jérôme Kunegis
<jerome.kunegis@unamur.be> so we can merge your changes into the master
version.
