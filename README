== KONECT Toolbox ==

This is a toolbox for the analysis of large complex networks written in
Matlab, but also largely compatible with GNU Octave.  It is used by the KONECT
Project:

http://konect.cc/

This toolbox largely implements the graph analysis functions described in 
the KONECT Handbook:

In particular, the KONECT Handbook contains all formal definitions of
the computations performed in this toolbox.

=== Installation ===

The toolbox consists entirely of *.m files.  To use it, add the
directory m/ to the Matlab path, e.g., using addpath() or by setting the
$MATLABPATH variable.

GNU Octave too supports the addpath() function and $MATLABPATH
variable. 

=== Requirements ===

Some functions need Matlab-BGL, the Matlab port of the Boost Graph
Library.    

Installation of Matlab-BGL:
* Download version 4.0.1 from the Matlab-BGL website (newer versions may
  not work) 
* Unzip it somewhere where you'll keep it
* (On a few old Debian-based systems, we needed to install libstdc++5 from http://packages.debian.org/stable/base/libstdc++5) 
* Make sure matlab_bgl/ is the the Matlab path.  This is necessary for
  both GNU Octave and Matlab.  For instance, do
	export MATLABPATH="$MATLABPATH:~/matlab_bgl/"
  (But probably you have your own way of setting the Matlab path.)

=== Usage ===

The toolbox consists of individual functions, each of which is
contained in its own *.m file in the m/ directory.  

Most functions are self-contained, and can be used as-is. 

Each function is documented in its source file.  

The source files contain UTF-8 encoded text in the comments; the rest is
ASCII.  

The functions are used from both GNU Octave Matlab and Matlab.  Since none of
these is properly standardised, we can't assure that all versions will
work -- when in doubt, ask.
