% The number of squares in a graph.

% The computed number of squares is independent of the orientation
% of edges.  The multiplicity of edges is ignored.  Loops in the
% graph are ignored.

% Method:  count all squares including overlapping edges, and
% remove from it the number of two-stars and edges.  (See exact
% formula below.)

% be used as temporary memory.  Used in the calculation of the default
% value of SIZE_CHUNK.

% multiplication does not work with logical matrices.

% Set diagonal elements to zero.

% Count all squares, including the twostars and edges.  This is the
% total count of squares including squares including those where
% multiple nodes overlap (being in fact edges and two-stars), and
% counting each orientation separately.

% How to get the actual number

% C:  total count of squares with overlap (count_total)

% C = 8 q + 2 m + 4 s
